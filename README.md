NAME

ansible

DESCRIPTION
-----------
a complete re-write of the awesome pythong ansible tool in just 42 lines of
ruby (not counting white space even though it does count in pythong).

the main awesomeness ansible provides is that, instead of writing logic in a
computer language, you get to write it in YAML.  everyone knows writing logic
in YAML is the next best thing to writing it in XML because neither contain
side effects and, though XML is very capable at describing logic, it is not
properly tail recursive.  in any case, both are vastly superior to doing it in
a turing complete language for reasons that should be obvious to the reader -
and every scala programmer.

ansible is simply simple deployments made simple again.  again.

SYNOPSIS
--------
* ansible all deploy rainbows
* ansible all install magic
* ansible all continuously integrate unicorns

etc.  other tasks are so simple they don't need documentation but, if you
want, you can run from master and use the mailing list.


INSTALL
-------
<strike>gem install ansible</strike>

actually get back to on that, there is already a gem call ansible and we're
busy rewriting rubygems in a yaml compatible format...
